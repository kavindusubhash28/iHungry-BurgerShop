This project is my coursework assignment for the iHungry Burger Shop Management System.
It is a Java-based console application developed to manage orders for a burger shop with a simple text-based interface.

The system allows the shop to:

Place new orders with automatic Order ID generation and customer details validation.

Search orders by Order ID or search customers by Customer ID with full order history.

View best customers ranked by total purchase amount.

Display orders under different statuses: Delivered, Preparing, and Cancelled, with proper formatting.

Update order details like quantity or status for pending orders only.

Technical Highlights:

Built using Java with only one main class and multiple methods.

Arrays are used for data storage (Order IDs, Customer IDs, Names, Quantities, Status).

Command-line interface for easy menu navigation.

Input validation for phone numbers, quantities, and menu options.

Follows a modular approach with separate methods for each functionality
